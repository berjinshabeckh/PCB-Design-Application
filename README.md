# PCB-Design-Application
# Aim
To design a pcb circuit board in eagle software.

# Software required
Eagle

# Procedure
1.Open a new schematic file within your project.</br>
2.Use the libraries provided in EAGLE or create custom libraries if necessary.</br>
3.Place components onto the schematic sheet by using the 'Add' tool.</br>
4.Connect the components using the 'Net' tool.</br>
5.Label nets appropriately to ensure clarity</br>
6.Once routing is complete, perform a ERC to ensure there are no errors and save the schematic.</br>
7.Click on the 'Generate/Switch to Board' icon to create a board from your schematic.</br>
8.EAGLE's board layout editor allows you to place components, route traces, and define board shapes.</br>
9.Arrange components on the board to optimize space usage and minimize signal interference.</br>
10.Route traces to connect components according to your schematic.</br>
11.Use the various routing and editing tools provided by EAGLE to ensure proper routing and avoid design rule violations.</br>
12.Once routing is complete, perform a design rule check (DRC) to ensure there are no errors and save the board layout.</br>
13.Go to File > CAM Processor and set up CAM jobs to generate Gerber files for your PCB layers.</br>
14.Verify generated files to ensure they contain all necessary information.</br>
15.Save the generated manufacturing files.</br>

# Theory

Fire Detection: This involves the detection of a fire through various means such as smoke detectors, heat sensors, or flame detectors. Early detection is crucial for initiating appropriate response actions.

Initiating Alarm: Once a fire is detected, alarms need to be activated to alert occupants of the building or premises. This can include audible alarms, visual signals like flashing lights, or automated messages through intercom systems.

Responding to the Alarm: Upon hearing or seeing the alarm, individuals must respond promptly and appropriately. This typically involves evacuating the premises following predetermined escape routes and procedures.

Evacuation and Emergency Response: Evacuation procedures should be followed promptly and calmly. This includes knowing the nearest exit routes, assisting others who may need help, and gathering at designated assembly points to ensure everyone is safely accounted for. Emergency response teams may also be activated to control and extinguish the fire.






## Working 

Control Panel: The control panel serves as the central hub of the fire alarm system. It receives signals from detection devices, processes this information, and activates alarms accordingly. The control panel also monitors the status of various system components and may include features such as zone control and system diagnostics.

Detection Devices: Smoke detectors, heat detectors, flame detectors, and other types of sensors are connected to the fire alarm circuit. These devices detect the presence of fire or smoke and transmit signals to the control panel when activated.

Alarm Initiating Devices: Alarm initiating devices, such as pull stations or manual call points, are also part of the fire alarm circuit. When activated by individuals in the event of a fire emergency, these devices send signals to the control panel to trigger alarms.


Wiring: Wiring serves as the physical connection between the various components of the fire alarm system. It carries electrical signals between devices and the control panel, enabling communication and coordination within the system.

Power Supply: The fire alarm circuit typically receives power from a reliable electrical source, such as a dedicated electrical circuit or backup battery system. This ensures that the system remains operational even during power outages.
